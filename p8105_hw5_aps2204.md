Homework 5
================

## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
     )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Let’s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = 
homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method     alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>      <chr>      
    ## 1   0.0538     2250.       0         1   0.0459    0.0629 1-sample … two.sided

Try to iterate…..

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

    ## Warning: Problem with `mutate()` input `prop_tests`.
    ## ℹ Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect
    ## ℹ Input `prop_tests` is `map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y))`.

    ## Warning in prop.test(x = .x, n = .y): Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

Read and tidy data

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
  path = list.files("lda_data")) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lda_data/", path),
    data = map(.x = path, ~ read_csv(.x))) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>% 
  separate(path, into = c("exp_group", "subject_id"), sep = "/") %>% 
  select(-"exp_group") %>% 

#using str_replace altered the dataframe completely; the only solution is to keep separating out the columns and deleting them. 
  
  separate(subject_id, into = c("exp_id", "throwaway"), sep = ".csv") %>% 
  select(-"throwaway") %>% 
  separate(exp_id, into = c("experiment_arm", "subject_id"), sep = "_") %>% 
  mutate(
    experiment_arm = recode(experiment_arm, con = "control", exp = "experimental")
  ) %>% 
  view()
```

Spaghetti time.

``` r
path_df %>% 
pivot_longer(week_1:week_8,
               names_to = "week",
               names_prefix = "week_",
               values_to = "observation") %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, group = subject_id, color = experiment_arm)) +
   geom_path() +
  labs(
    title = "Observations over Time for 20 Subjects in the Experimental and Control Study Arms",
    x = "Week",
    y = "Observation Value"
  ) 
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_aps2204_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="90%" />
Based on this plot, it is apparent that the experimental arm of the
study has higher observed values on average than the control arm.
Further, the experimental arm appears to have an overall upward trend
over time, while the control arm appears to have an overall downward
trend over time. The spread of observations in both arms appears to
decrease between weeks 7 and 8, though this may simply be a product of
how the data is not displayed after week 8. The experimental arm appears
to display the same amount of spread as the control arm.

Building a function

``` r
framework_3 = rnorm(30, mean = 0, sd = 5)
